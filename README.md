## About morphine

I wanted to simulate optics and use automatic differentiation to make derivatives - but do it in a style that will be familiar to most astronomers. So I forked poppy to work with the (Google Jax)[https://github.com/google/jax] framework, an autodiff library that closely resembles NumPy. The important thing to remember is it doesn't like Astropy units, so we had to throw these all out - be careful! 

## About poppy

POPPY (**P**\ hysical **O**\ ptics **P**\ ropagation in **Py**\ thon) is a Python package that simulates physical optical propagation including diffraction. It implements a flexible framework for modeling Fraunhofer and Fresnel diffraction and point spread function formation, particularly in the context of astronomical telescopes.

POPPY was developed as part of a simulation package for the James Webb Space Telescope, but is more broadly applicable to many kinds of imaging simulations. It is not, however, a substitute for high fidelity optical design software such as Zemax or Code V, but rather is intended as a lightweight alternative for cases for which diffractive rather than geometric optics is the topic of interest, and which require portability between platforms or ease of scripting.
