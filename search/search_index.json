It implements a flexible framework for modeling Fraunhofer and Fresnel diffraction and point spread function formation, particularly in the context of astronomical telescopes. POPPY was developed as part of a simulation package for the James Webb Space Telescope, but is more broadly applicable to many kinds of imaging simulations. It is not, however, a substitute for high fidelity optical design software such as Zemax or Code V, but rather is intended as a lightweight alternative for cases for which diffractive rather than geometric optics is the topic of interest, and which require portability between platforms or ease of scripting.
